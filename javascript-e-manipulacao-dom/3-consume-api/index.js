/*
Challenge 3 — Fetch + Render Users (API + DOM)

Interview context
“You need to consume an API, show results in the UI, and handle loading + errors.”

🎯 Goal

Fetch a list of users from an API and render them into the DOM.

✅ Use this API (free, no key):
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Requirements — JavaScript
1 - When the page loads, show Loading...
2 - Fetch users from the API using fetch
3 - If success:
- Render a list of users
- Each item must show: Name, Email, City (from adress.city)
4 - If error:
- Show "Something went wrong. Try again."
- Show a Retry button
5 - Retry button must retech the data
6 - Keep DOM updates clean (use render() style functions)

Bonus (optional, but interview-friendly):
- Add a search input to filter users by name (client-side)
